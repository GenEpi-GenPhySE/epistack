Description: The epistack package main objective is the visualizations of
    stacks of genomic tracks (such as, but not restricted to, ChIP-seq,
    ATAC-seq, DNA methyation or genomic conservation data)
    centered at genomic regions of interest. epistack needs three 
    different inputs: 1) a genomic score objects, such as ChIP-seq coverage or 
    DNA methylation values, 
    provided as a `GRanges` (easily obtained from `bigwig` or `bam` files). 
    2) a list of feature of interest, such as peaks or transcription start
    sites, provided as a `GRanges` (easily obtained from `gtf` or `bed` files). 
    3) a score to sort the features, such as peak height or gene
    expression value.
